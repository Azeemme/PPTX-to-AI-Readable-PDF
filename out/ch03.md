# Assignment
The general syntax for an assignment statement is
	variable = operand;
The operand to the right of the assignment operator (=) can be a constant, a variable, or an expression
The equal sign in C does not have the same meaning as an equal sign in algebra
length=25; is read “length is assigned the value 25”
Subsequent assignment statements can be used to change the value assigned to a variable
length = 3.7;
length = 6.28;

![[ch03.pdf#page=10]]

# Assignment (continued)
The operand to the right of the equal sign in an assignment statement can be a variable or any valid C expression
	sum = 3 + 7;
	product = .05 * 14.6;
The value of the expression to the right of = is computed first and then the calculated value is stored in the variable to the left of =
Variables used in the expression to the right of the = must be initialized if the result is to make sense
amount + 1892 = 1000 + 10 * 5 is invalid!

# Assignment (continued)
= has the lowest precedence of all the binary and unary arithmetic operators introduced in Section 2.4
Multiple assignments are possible in the same statement
	a = b = c = 25;
All = operators have the same precedence
Operator has right-to-left associativity
c = 25;
b = c;
a = b;

# Implicit Type Conversions
Data type conversions take place across assignment operators
double result;
result = 4; //integer 4 is converted to 4.0
The automatic conversion across an assignment operator is called an implicit type conversion
int answer;
answer = 2.764; //2.764 is converted to 2
Here the implicit conversion is from a higher precision to a lower precision data type; the compiler will issue a warning

# Explicit Type Conversions (Casts)
The operator used to force the conversion of a value to another type is the cast operator
	(dataType) expression
where dataType is the desired data type of the expression following the cast
Example:
If sum is declared as double sum;, (int) sum is the integer value determined by truncating sum’s fractional part

# Assignment Variations

![](Picture4.jpg)
sum = sum + 10 is not an equation—it is an expression that is evaluated in two major steps

![[ch03.pdf#page=24]]

# Assignment Variations (continued)
Assignment expressions like sum = sum + 25 can be written using the following operators:
+= -= *= /= %=
sum = sum + 10 can be written as sum += 10
price *= rate is equivalent to price = price * rate
price *= rate + 1 is equivalent to price = price * (rate + 1)

# Accumulating
The first statement initializes sum to 0
This removes any previously stored value in sum that would invalidate the final total
A previously stored number, if it has not been initialized to a specific and known value, is frequently called a garbage value

# Counting
A counting statement is very similar to the accumulating statement
	variable = variable + fixedNumber;
Examples: i = i + 1; and m = m + 2;
Increment operator (++): variable = variable + 1 can be replaced by variable++ or ++variable

# Counting (continued)
When the ++ operator appears before a variable, it is called a prefix increment operator; when it appears after a variable, it is called postfix increment operator
k = ++n; is equivalent to
n = n + 1; // increment n first
k = n; // assign n's value to k
k = n++; is equivalent to
k = n; // assign n's value to k
n = n + 1; // and then increment n

![[ch03.pdf#page=37]]

# Counting (continued)
Prefix decrement operator: the expression k = --n first decrements the value of n by 1 before assigning the value of n to k
Postfix decrement operator: the expression k = n-- first assigns the current value of n to n and then reduces the value of n by 1

# Interactive Input (continued)

# Interactive Input (continued)
scanf() can be used to enter many values
scanf("%f %f",&num1,&num2); //"%f%f" is the same
A space can affect what the value being entered is when scanf() is expecting a character data type
scanf("%c%c%c",&ch1,&ch2,&ch3); stores the next three characters typed in the variables ch1, ch2, and ch3; if you type x y z, then x is stored in ch1, a blank is stored in ch2, and y is stored in ch3
scanf("%c %c %c",&ch1,&ch2,&ch3); causes scanf() to look for three characters, each character separated by exactly one space
